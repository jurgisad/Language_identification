Language_Identification Project
This project, commissioned by Euromonitor, aims to develop a robust data pipeline to enhance the accuracy of scraped multilingual data.

The pipeline uses a funnel-down approach, where each stage incrementally refines the dataset, ultimately isolating a small subset of uncertain cases for which no automatic language label is assigned. This minimizes false assumptions and ensures high confidence in labeled data.

The methodology combines:

Classic statistical techniques

Modern machine learning models

Rule-based logic

All methods applied were scientifically researched, and their theoretical justification can be found in the accompanying report. For full technical details of the proposed pipeline, refer to the PDF, section "Tiriamoji dalis – Siūlomas metodas" on page 22.
